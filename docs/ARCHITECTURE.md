## Overview

The GenLayer Fee Distribution Simulator is a comprehensive system for modeling and testing fee distribution mechanisms in a blockchain validator network. It simulates complex transaction scenarios involving validators, leaders, appeals, and various edge cases to ensure correct fee distribution.

### Key Design Principles
- **Path-based Flow**: The system follows a deterministic flow from graph paths to fee distributions
- **Content-based Detection**: Round types are determined by vote patterns, not indices
- **Immutable Data Structures**: All fee events are immutable for auditability
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Every path through the system is tested with 22 invariants
- **Exhaustive Verification**: Can generate ~113M paths for external validation

        JSON[JSON Export]
        DR --> FE

        FE --> JSON
    end
```

## Data Flow

The system follows a strict unidirectional data flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant G as TRANSITIONS_GRAPH
    participant P as Path
    participant T as TransactionRoundResults
    participant L as Round Labels
    participant F as Fee Events
    participant J as JSON Export
    
    G->>P: Generate valid paths
    P->>T: Convert to transaction structure
    T->>L: Label rounds by content
    L->>F: Distribute fees by label
    F->>F: Calculate refunds
    F->>J: Export compressed JSON
```

### 1. **Graph → Path**
- The `TRANSITIONS_GRAPH` in `tests/round_combinations/graph_data.py` defines all valid state transitions
- Path generator creates sequences like `["START", "LEADER_RECEIPT_MAJORITY_AGREE", "APPEAL_VALIDATOR_SUCCESSFUL", "END"]`
- Single source of truth for all possible transaction flows

### 2. **Path → Transaction**
- `path_to_transaction.py` converts paths to `TransactionRoundResults`
- Creates appropriate vote patterns for each node type
- Generates `TransactionBudget` with appeal information
- Handles consecutive appeals correctly

### 3. **Transaction → Labels**
- `round_labeling.py` analyzes vote patterns to determine round types
- No dependency on round indices - purely content-based
- Applies special pattern transformations (e.g., SKIP_ROUND)
- Handles consecutive appeals by looking back to original normal round

### 4. **Labels → Fees**
- `distribute_round.py` routes to specific distribution functions
- Each label has a corresponding fee distribution strategy
- Events are immutable and include all transaction details

### 5. **Fees → Export**
- `scripts/generate_path_jsons.py` exports compressed JSON files
- Sequential address numbering (1, 2, 3...)
- Bitfield encoding for invariant results
- ~800 bytes per path vs 43KB uncompressed

## Key Components

### Models (`models.py`)
```python
# Core data structures
TransactionRoundResults  # Contains all rounds in a transaction
Round                   # Contains rotations (re-elections)
Rotation               # Contains votes from participants
TransactionBudget      # Defines costs and appeals
FeeEvent              # Immutable record of fee changes
Appeal                # Appeal information with appealant address
```

### Constants
```python
# Round sizes (after ROUND_SIZES split)
NORMAL_ROUND_SIZES = [5, 11, 23, 47, 95, 191, 383, 767, 1000]
APPEAL_ROUND_SIZES = [7, 13, 25, 49, 97, 193, 385, 769, 1000]

# Penalty coefficients
PENALTY_REWARD_COEFFICIENT = 1
IDLE_PENALTY_COEFFICIENT = 10
DETERMINISTIC_VIOLATION_PENALTY_COEFFICIENT = 100
```

### Vote Types
- `LEADER_RECEIPT`: Leader successfully submitted a result
- `LEADER_TIMEOUT`: Leader failed to submit in time
- `AGREE`/`DISAGREE`: Validator votes on leader's submission
- `TIMEOUT`: Validator didn't vote in time
- `IDLE`: Validator was idle (replaced)
- `NA`: Not applicable (used in appeals)

## Round Types and Labeling

### Detection Logic
Round types are detected based on vote patterns, not indices:

```mermaid
graph TD
    V[Votes in Round]
    V --> A{All NA votes?}
    A -->|Yes| LA[Leader Appeal]
    A -->|No| B{Has LEADER_TIMEOUT?}
    B -->|Yes| LT[Leader Timeout Round]
    B -->|No| C{Has LEADER_RECEIPT?}
    C -->|Yes| NR[Normal Round]
    C -->|No| D{Has AGREE/DISAGREE?}
    D -->|Yes| VA[Validator Appeal]
    D -->|No| ER[Empty Round]
```

### Round Labels
1. **Normal Rounds**
   - `NORMAL_ROUND`: Standard round with clear outcome
   - `LEADER_TIMEOUT`: Leader failed to respond
   - `SKIP_ROUND`: Retroactively skipped due to successful appeal

2. **Appeal Rounds**
   - `APPEAL_LEADER_SUCCESSFUL/UNSUCCESSFUL`: Leader being appealed
   - `APPEAL_VALIDATOR_SUCCESSFUL/UNSUCCESSFUL`: Validators appealing majority
   - `APPEAL_LEADER_TIMEOUT_SUCCESSFUL/UNSUCCESSFUL`: Timeout being appealed

3. **Special Cases**
   - `LEADER_TIMEOUT_50_PERCENT`: Single timeout round
   - `LEADER_TIMEOUT_150_PREVIOUS_NORMAL_ROUND`: After successful timeout appeal
   - `LEADER_TIMEOUT_50_PREVIOUS_APPEAL_BOND`: After unsuccessful appeal
   - `SPLIT_PREVIOUS_APPEAL_BOND`: Undetermined after unsuccessful appeal

### Pattern Transformations
Special patterns trigger label transformations:

```python
# Example: Skip round before successful appeal
["NORMAL_ROUND", "APPEAL_LEADER_SUCCESSFUL", "NORMAL_ROUND"]
# Transforms to:
["SKIP_ROUND", "APPEAL_LEADER_SUCCESSFUL", "NORMAL_ROUND"]
```

### Consecutive Appeal Handling
The system correctly handles consecutive appeals:
```python
def classify_appeal_round(round_index, rounds, leader_addresses):
    # Look back to find the original normal round being appealed
    original_round_index = round_index - 1
    while original_round_index > 0:
        if is_likely_appeal_round(rounds[original_round_index], ...):
            original_round_index -= 1
        else:
            break
    # Classify based on the original normal round
```

## Fee Distribution Logic

### Distribution Router
```mermaid
graph LR
    L[Round Label] --> D{Distribute Round}
    D --> |NORMAL_ROUND| NR[apply_normal_round]
    D --> |APPEAL_*_SUCCESSFUL| AS[apply_appeal_successful]
    D --> |APPEAL_*_UNSUCCESSFUL| AU[apply_appeal_unsuccessful]
    D --> |LEADER_TIMEOUT_*| LT[apply_leader_timeout_variant]
    D --> |SPLIT_PREVIOUS_APPEAL_BOND| SB[apply_split_bond]
```

### Fee Event Structure
```python
FeeEvent(
    sequence_id=1,          # Global sequence number
    address="0x...",        # Participant address
    round_index=0,          # Round in transaction
    round_label="NORMAL_ROUND",
    role="VALIDATOR",       # LEADER, VALIDATOR, APPEALANT, SENDER
    vote="AGREE",          
    earned=200,            # Amount earned
    cost=0,                # Amount paid
    burned=0,              # Amount burned (penalties)
    slashed=0,             # Amount slashed
    staked=0               # Stake changes
)
```

### Distribution Examples

#### Normal Round (Majority Agree)
- Leader: Earns `leader_timeout + validator_timeout`
- Majority validators: Earn `validator_timeout`
- Minority validators: Burned `PENALTY_REWARD_COEFFICIENT * validator_timeout`

#### Successful Appeal
- Appealant: Earns `appeal_bond + leader_timeout` (leader appeal) or `appeal_bond` (validator appeal)
- Validators: Distribution depends on appeal type

#### Split Bond (Undetermined after unsuccessful appeal)
- Leader: Earns `leader_timeout`
- Validators: Split the appeal bond equally

- Exports compressed JSON files (~800 bytes each)
- Sequential address numbering (1, 2, 3...)
- Bitfield encoding for invariant results
- Organized by path length

### JSON Format
```json
{
  "path": [0, 1, 6, 12],           // Node indices
  "labels": [0, 6],                // Round label indices
  "participants": {                // Only active participants
    "1": {
      "r": [[0,0], [1,1]],        // [round_index, role_index]
      "c": 0,                     // cost
      "e": 300,                   // earned
      "s": 0,                     // slashed
      "b": 0                      // burned
    }
  },
  "invariants": 4194303,          // Bitfield (all 22 bits set)
  "hash": "0cd0354f..."           // Path hash
}
```

### Path Visualization (`scripts/decode_path_json.py`)
- Decodes compressed JSON format
- Reconstructs full transaction
- Displays multiple visualizations:
  - Compressed data summary
  - Transaction results
  - Fee distribution details
  - Summary table

### Export Statistics
- Length 3: 4 paths
- Length 7: 484 paths
- Length 17: ~113M paths (estimated)

## Recent Refactors

### 1. **ROUND_SIZES Split**
- Split `ROUND_SIZES` into `NORMAL_ROUND_SIZES` and `APPEAL_ROUND_SIZES`
- Allows independent sizing for normal rounds vs appeals
- Simplifies chained appeal handling

### 2. **Index-based to Content-based Detection**
- Removed all `i % 2` logic for appeal detection
- Appeals detected by vote patterns (NA votes, no leader receipt)
- More flexible and maintainable

### 3. **Path-based Testing**
- Moved from manual test case creation to path generation
- `TRANSITIONS_GRAPH` as single source of truth
- Exhaustive testing of all valid scenarios

### 4. **Appeal Index Calculation**
- Removed `floor(round_index / 2)` calculations
- Count actual appeal rounds to find indices
- Find previous normal rounds by searching backwards

### 5. **Consecutive Appeal Fix**
- Fixed round labeling to handle consecutive appeals
- Look back through appeal chain to find original normal round
- Prevents misclassification of chained appeals

### 6. **JSON Export System**
- Added compressed JSON export for all paths
- Enables external verification by consensus team
- Efficient format reduces storage by 98%

## Configuration and Extension

### Adding New Round Types
1. Add to `RoundLabel` type definition
2. Create distribution function in `round_fee_distribution/`
3. Add case in `distribute_round.py`
4. Update pattern matching in `round_labeling.py`
5. Add to lookup tables in export scripts
6. Add tests

### Adding New Vote Types
1. Update `Vote` type definition
2. Modify vote pattern detection in `is_likely_appeal_round()`
3. Update majority calculation if needed
4. Add test cases

### Modifying Penalties
1. Update coefficient constants
2. Ensure distribution functions use constants
3. Run invariant tests to verify conservation

## Performance Considerations

- **Path Generation**: Exponential growth with max length
  - Length 3: 4 paths
  - Length 7: 484 paths
  - Length 17: ~113 million paths
- **Memory**: Fee events are kept in memory
- **JSON Export**: ~800 bytes per path compressed
- **Optimization**: Use batch processing for large path sets

## Round Sizes and Validator Selection Logic

### Round Size Constants

The system uses two separate arrays for round sizes defined in `constants.py`:

```python
NORMAL_ROUND_SIZES = [5, 11, 23, 47, 95, 191, 383, 767, 1000]
APPEAL_ROUND_SIZES = [7, 13, 25, 49, 97, 193, 385, 769, 1000]
```

These sizes follow an exponential growth pattern (approximately doubling) to:
- Ensure sufficient validators for consensus
- Scale security with transaction importance
- Balance between decentralization and efficiency

### Validator Selection Patterns

There are two main patterns for validator selection depending on appeal outcomes:

#### Pattern 1: Successful Appeal
When an appeal is successful, validators are combined:
```
Next round size = Previous normal round + Appeal round - 1
```
Where the `-1` represents excluding the original leader who was appealed.

#### Pattern 2: Chained Unsuccessful Appeals
When appeals are unsuccessful and chained, the system progresses through the arrays independently:
```
Normal rounds: Use next index in NORMAL_ROUND_SIZES
Appeal rounds: Use next index in APPEAL_ROUND_SIZES
```

### Key Properties

1. **Leader Exclusion**: Only occurs after successful appeals
2. **Independent Progression**: Unsuccessful appeals don't affect round size calculation
3. **Array Index Tracking**: System maintains separate indices for normal and appeal rounds
4. **Validator Pool Growth**: New validators are added as needed to meet round sizes

## Future Enhancements

1. **Parallel Processing**: For large-scale path generation
2. **Incremental Export**: Stream JSON files instead of batch
3. **Path Filtering**: Generate only specific path patterns
4. **Visualization Dashboard**: Web interface for path exploration
5. **Performance Metrics**: Track processing time per path
