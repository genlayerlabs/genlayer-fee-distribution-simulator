    Test fee distribution for a normal round where some validators are idle.
    
    Description:
    This test verifies the fee distribution and stake slashing in a normal round where two validators
    are idle and are replaced by reserve validators. The leader and active validators vote 'AGREE',
    while one reserve validator votes 'DISAGREE'. The test checks:
    - Correct round labeling as 'NORMAL_ROUND'.
    - Idle validators are slashed 1% of their stake.
    - The leader earns both leader and validator timeouts.
    - Active validators (including the agreeing reserve validator) earn validator timeouts.
    - The disagreeing reserve validator is penalized.
    - The sender's costs and refunds are correct.
    - All non-participating addresses have zero fees.
